  <p>I knew that I might get hacked for giving this talk, so
   let me save you the effort.<br><br> In true TED fashion, here
   is my most embarrassing picture. But it would be diffi
  cult for you to find me in it, because I'm the one who looks
  like a boy standing to the side. I was such a nerd back
  then that even the boys on the Dungeons and Dragons team
  wouldn't let me join. This is who I was, but this is who
  I wanted to be: Angelina Jolie. She portrayed Acid Burn in
  the '95 film "Hackers." She was pretty and she could rollerblade, but being a hacker, that made her
  powerful. And I wanted to be just like her, so I started
  spending a lot of time on hacker chat rooms and online
  forums.

  </p><p>I remember one late night I found a bit of PHP code.
  I didn't really know what it did,
  but I copy-pasted it and used itanyway to get into a
  password-protected site like that. Open Sesame.
  It was a simple trick, and I was just a script
  kiddie back then, but to me, that trick, it felt like this,
  like I had discovered limitless potential at my fingertips.
  This is the rush of power that hackers feel. It's geeks
  just like me discovering they have access to superpower,
  one that requires the skill and tenacity of their intellect
  , but thankful
  ly no radioactive spiders.</p>
